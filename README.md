# Machine_Learning_IRISDataset
This a smaill beginner friendly project on Iris dataset.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to analyse the structure of the dataset its features and classes and also try to determine the undermine relationship between the classes using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you will need a text editor. You can use Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Sublime Text or any other text editor of your choice. I used here Jupyter notebook and generated a .ipynb file. 
Please do not forget to download the Iris.csv file and keep it in the same directory as your .py or .ipynb file. You will find the Iris.csv file in the repository.

## Description

The Iris flower dataset is consisted of 3 classes of 50 instances each. The 3 classes refers to different types of iris plants which are setosa, virginica and versicolour. There are 4 main attributes, sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width that describes the features of each type of iris plant.

## Implementation

In order to implement PCA (Principal Component Analysis) in Iris dataset I projected the 4D feature space into 2d feature space and visualized the relationship between the 3 types of iris plants.

## Results
The visualization shows that, Versicolor and Virginica are some how more similar in terms of features than Setosa. Setosa demonstatres more independent and unique feature.
